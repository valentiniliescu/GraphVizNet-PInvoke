# GraphVizNet-PInvoke

There are two ways of integrating GraphViz native binaries: launching the "dot" tool in a new process or using PInvoke. This library represents my experiments using the latter approach, but there are various issues with deployment. 
I had more success with the other approach here [https://github.com/valentiniliescu/GraphVizNet](https://github.com/valentiniliescu/GraphVizNet).
